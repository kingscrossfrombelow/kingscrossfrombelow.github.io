King's Cross from Below is an open-access book published by UCL Press (2026), co-edited by Michael Edwards and Jason Katz, and produced with an initial crowd of 36 wonderful contributors. This website serves as its living companion: an indexed archive of planning documents, oral histories, and collaborative knowledge produced through four decades of resistance and redevelopment in King's Cross and extending forward into the ongoing campaigns which emerged from this work.
Each page on this site corresponds to a contribution in the book and carries a permanent URL for citation. The site is archived by the British Library, ensuring long-term accessibility for researchers, residents, activists, and anyone engaged with questions of urban development, community organizing, and planning from below.
This is not a closed repository. Contributors and readers are invited to submit materials, reflections, and documents that extend the conversations begun in these pages. The infrastructure here is designed to remain open to encounter — to support ongoing campaigns, and to make visible the genealogical chains of planning decisions that continue to shape London's communities.
